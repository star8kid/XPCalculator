# XPCalculator

### A Tkinter Application that can be used to calculate various actions in the game *Minecraft* and return how long or how much exp is needed to reach certain levels. This will be useful for figuring out:

- How many *Bottle O' Enchantment* bottles are needed to raise you to a certain level
- Average range of time needed at a grinder to raise up to a certain level
- Many other features! ~~As suggested by peers~~

## Enjoy!

# Current Features

- `Calculate From Level Zero` is a feature that will calculate the total amount of experience needed when a player has a starting level of `0`. Though this feature isn't overally useful, it should still be included as an option because **math**.
- **No longer will you wonder, 'How long do I have to grind for?'**.`Grinding Duration` is a feature that will calculate the average of time needed to achieve a target level from a current level. This calculation will also require an input of an average exp gain rate, which will be measured in `ExperiencePoints/Second`. In order to get this number, use the following equation:
```
    Average Exp Gain = Total Amount of Exp Earned / Amount of Seconds that passed
```
